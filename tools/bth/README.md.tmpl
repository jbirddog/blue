# BlueVM Test Harness

Patched version of the BlueVM with extended opcodes to facilitate testing.

## Building

To build `bth` run `make` after `make` has been run in the root of the repo.

## Opcodes

Public opcodes that can be used in tests to produce TAP output. Test files written in `blasm` can include `tap.inc`
from this repository. For an example test file see `test/bth.bla`.

| Opcode | Name | Stack Effect | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
_TAP_OPS_TBL_

### Internal Opcodes

These internal opcodes are used by bth itself and should not be considered stable for external use.

| Opcode | Name | Stack Effect | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
_INTERNAL_OPS_TBL_

## TODOs

1. Print "TAP version 14" when testing begins
1. Redo wprep, wlen, waddr to use cxord, cmovd, etc
1. bth.inc and tap.inc tmpl/sh files could be merged
1. ops_tap.bla can call internal ops directly
