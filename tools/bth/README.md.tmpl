# BlueVM Test Harness

Standalone executable to run BlueVM bytecode test files and produce TAP output.

## Building

Run `make` at the root of this repository to build `bth` and its dependencies (`BlueVM` and `blasm`). Once that has
been done, running `make` in this directory will build just `bth`.

## Running

`./bin/bth path/to/test/file.bs0` will execute a test file and print its TAP output.

`prove -e ./bin/bth --ext bs0 path/to/tost` will use `prove` to run test files.

## Opcodes

Public opcodes that can be used in tests to produce TAP output. Test files written in `blasm` can include `tap.inc`
from this repository. For an example test file see `test/bth.bla`. The BlueVM test suite uses `bth` and contains
test files in `../../test`.

| Opcode | Name | Stack Effect | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
_TAP_OPS_TBL_

### Internal Opcodes

These internal opcodes are used by bth itself and should not be considered stable for external use.

| Opcode | Name | Stack Effect | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
_INTERNAL_OPS_TBL_

## TODOs

1. Print "TAP version 14" when testing begins
1. Redo wprep, wlen, waddr to use cxord, cmovd, etc
1. bth.inc and tap.inc tmpl/sh files could be merged
1. Add link to TAP website
1. See about getting listed as a TAP producer
