# BlueVM

Minimalistic 64 bit Forth-like virtual machine for hackers. The BlueVM aims to:

1. Have a simplistic and hackable codebase
1. Support execution of any previously compiled bytecode
1. Provide a minimal set of opcodes that can be extended by the host
1. Serve as the basis for minimalistic handcrafted applications
1. Allow the host full control
1. Bring some fun back into the world

By convention BlueVM bytecode files have a `bs0` (BlueVM Stage 0) extension.

## Building

To build the BlueVM, tools and examples run ./build.sh

## Memory Layout

The BlueVM requires a single allocation with the following layout in rwx memory:

1. Input Buffer (1024 bytes)
1. Data Stack (1024 bytes)
1. Opcode Map (2048 bytes)
   1. BlueVM Opcode Map: 0x00 - 0x7F (1024 bytes)
   1. Extended Opcode Map: 0x80 - 0xFF (1024 bytes)
1. Code Buffer (4096 bytes)
   1. BlueVM Data (128 bytes)
   1. Space for Host (3968 bytes)

## Boot

When the BlueVM starts it will perform the allocation mentioned above and set the following 8 byte values in the
BlueVM Data portion of the beginning of the code buffer:

1. BlueVM state
1. Location of the input buffer
1. Location of the input buffer's here
1. Input buffer length
1. Location of the data stack
1. Location of the data stack's here
1. Data stack length
1. Location of the opcode map
1. Location of the code buffer
1. Location of the code buffer's here
1. Code buffer length
1. Location of opcode handler

BlueVM will then read 1024 bytes from stdin into the input buffer and begin interpreting the bytecode. The contents
of this initial 1024 bytes serve as the bootstrap for the host.

## Execution

BlueVM follows a simple byte oriented execution strategy. Using the values from the BlueVM data portion of the code
buffer it:

1. Checks if a byte is available in the input buffer
   1. If not exit
   1. If so read a byte and increment the input buffer's here by one byte
1. Locate the opcode entry in the opcode map
   1. If it is 0 exit with bad opcode
1. Call the opcode handler
1. Goto 1

Because of this "late binding" approach, the host can change the values that the BlueVM uses to execute, including
opcodes, granting it full control.

## Opcode Map Structure

Each entry in the opcode map is 8 bytes.

1. Relative offset from code buffer start (4 bytes)
1. Opcode length (1 byte)
1. Flags (1 byte)
1. Reserved (1 byte)

## Opcode Handler

Once an opcode entry is located in the opcode map the opcode handler is called. The BlueVM has two opcode handlers,
interpret (default) and compile. The interpret handler calls the code using the relative offset from the code
buffer specified in the op code entry. The compile handler finds the opcode length in the opcode entry and copies
that many bytes, including the opcode, into the code buffer and advances the code buffer's here.

## Opcodes

All opcodes are represented in hexdecimal. Stack effect abbreviations:

| Abbreviation | Description |
|----|----|
| b | Byte |
| w | Word |
| d | Double word |
| q | Quad word |

| Opcode | Stack Effect | Description |
|----|----|----|
| 00 | ( -- ) | Halt execution of the BlueVM |
