# Blue

Blue is a single-pass bytecode interpreter for a [colorForth](https://colorforth.github.io/index.html) dialect. It is a single shot application with an intentionally limited scope that focuses on generating output. Like any Forth, an emphasis is placed on building user defined vocabularies.
