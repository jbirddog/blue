# Blue

Blue is a single-pass bytecode interpreter for a [colorForth](https://colorforth.github.io/index.html) dialect. Unlike the traditional `colorForth` system, Blue is a single shot application with a sole focus on generating output. Like any Forth, an emphasis is placed on building user defined vocabularies to describe and solve the problem at hand.

Blue aims to:

1. Have a reasonably small, simplistic and hackable codebase that a single human can completely understand
1. Help create minimalistic handcrafted applications
1. Bring some fun back into the world

This is the reference implementation for x86_64 Linux.
